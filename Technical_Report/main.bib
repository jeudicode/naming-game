	abstract = {What processes can explain how very large populations are able to converge on the use of a
	particular word or grammatical construction without global coordination? Answering this
	question helps to understand why new language constructs usually propagate along an
	S-shaped curve with a rather sudden transition towards global agreement. It also helps to
	analyse and design new technologies that support or orchestrate self-organizing
	communication systems, such as recent social tagging systems for the web. The article
	introduces and studies a microscopic model of communicating autonomous agents
	performing language games without any central control. We show that the system
	undergoes a disorder/order transition, going through a sharp symmetry breaking process to
	reach a shared set of conventions. Before the transition, the system builds up
	non-trivial scale-invariant correlations, for instance in the distribution of competing
	synonyms, which display a Zipf-like law. These correlations make the system ready
	for the transition towards shared conventions, which, observed on the timescale
	of collective behaviours, becomes sharper and sharper with system size. This
	surprising result not only explains why human language can scale up to very
	large populations but also suggests ways to optimize artificial semiotic dynamics.}

	abstract={The paper investigates the dynamical properties of spatially distributed naming games. Naming games are interactions between two agents, a speaker and a hearer, in which the speaker identifies an object using a name. Adaptive naming games imply that speaker and hearer update their lexicons to become better in future games. By engaging in adaptive naming games, a coherent shared vocabulary arises through self-organisation in a population of distributed agents. When the agents are spatially distributed, diversity can be shown to arise, and changes, in population contact lead to language changes.},
